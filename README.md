# machine_learning_portfolio
A repository to showcase what I've learned from the course "Introduction to Machine Learning"

## An Overview of Machine Learning
I explain what machine learning is, cover some important terminology, discuss fascinating applications of machine learning, and then talk about my own interest in machine learning in this [PDF](overview_of_ML.pdf). 

## Data Exploration in C++ 
R has built-in functions named sum(), mean(), median(), range(), cov() (to find covariance between two variables), and cor() (to find the Pearson correlation coefficent between two variables). I coded the functionality of each of these functions in C++ in order to get a better understanding of the built-in R functions. The C++ code can be found [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/data_exploration/main.cpp) and a PDF explaining the code can be found [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/data_exploration/data_exploration_explanation.pdf)

## Linear Models
I explored linear regression models with R in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/linear_models/linear_regression.pdf) built from this [R-notebook](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/linear_models/linear_regression.rmd). I also explored logistic regression models and the Naive Bayes model with R in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/linear_models/classification.pdf) built from this [R-notebook](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/linear_models/classification.rmd).

## ML from Scratch
In the previous assignment, I built a logistic regression model and a Naive Bayes model using built-in R functions. For this assignment, I coded the algorithms to build a logistic regression model and Naive Bayes model from scratch. The logistic regression model that I built was used to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic crash based on their sex, and the Naive Bayes model that I built was used to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic crash based on their passenger class, sex, and age. The C++ code for the logistic regression model I built can be found [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/ML_from_scratch/logistic_regression.cpp) and the C++ code for the Naive Bayes model I built can be found [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/ML_from_scratch/naive_bayes.cpp). I posted images of my test runs, analyzed my results, compared generative classifiers and discriminitive classifiers, and discussed reproducible research in machine learning in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/ML_from_scratch/ml_from_scratch_explanation.pdf). 

## Searching for Similarity
My team and I explored linear regression, KNN regression, and decision tree regression in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/searching_for_similarity/RegressionNotebook.pdf), logistic regression, KNN classification, and decision trees classification in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/searching_for_similarity/ClassificationNotebook.pdf), k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and model based clustering in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/searching_for_similarity/clustering.pdf), and PCA and LDA dimensionality reduction in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/searching_for_similarity/PCA_LDA.pdf). We explained all of our work in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/searching_for_similarity/Searching_For_Similarity.pdf). 

## Kernel and Ensemble Methods
My partner and I explored regression through SVM in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/kernel_and_ensemble_methods/SVM_Regression.pdf), classification through SVM in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/kernel_and_ensemble_methods/SVM_Classification.Rmd), and a few ensemble methods as well in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/kernel_and_ensemble_methods/ensemble_methods.pdf). We wrote about our experiences [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/kernel_and_ensemble_methods/kernel_and_ensemble_methods_writeup.pdf). 

## ML with sklearn
I explored machine learning with Python libraries in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/machine_learning_portfolio/blob/main/ml_with_sklearn/ml_with_sklearn.pdf). I used logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks to classify whether a car had a higher mpg than average based on a variety of predictors using sklearn.
