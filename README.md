# machine_learning_portfolio
A repository to showcase what I've learned from the course "Introduction to Machine Learning"

## An Overview of Machine Learning
I explain what machine learning is, cover some important terminology, discuss fascinating applications of machine learning, and then talk about my own interest in machine learning in this [PDF](overview_of_ML.pdf). 

## Data Exploration in C++ 
R has built-in functions named sum(), mean(), median(), range(), cov() (to find covariance between two variables), and cor() (to find the Pearson correlation coefficent between two variables). I coded the functionality of each of these functions in C++ in order to get a better understanding of the built-in R functions. The C++ code can be found [here](data_exploration/main.cpp) and a PDF explaining the code can be found [here](data_exploration/data_exploration_explanation.pdf)
